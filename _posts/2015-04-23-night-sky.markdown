### I don't know a title for that

I didn't know what to put in here, so I decided to put in just a few life experiences I've been through and updating over time, something like a diary I think.

I always had a little anxiety and she eventually developed into higher education, which caused a shock in the first year of the course.
But luckily I met some people who completely changed my life, friends that I hope to take for the rest of my life, even though some I never see again after graduating, I hope someday to be able to repay everything I was given.
Many of my goals during the course are being done, nothing too big, things like "getting past some math stuff."
What I am looking for now is to try to give my teachers less work and get a degree.
If I can do it, I don't know, but I'll keep tapping while I'm standing

## 08/12/2019

   I’ve decided that I’m going to update this page over the days, taking advantage of the fact that it’s a personal page and probably no one will read it, and it turns out to be safer than the texts I typed into the computer.
It’s weird to type for myself, but in the end I feel like it’s a conversation with my real self, so I decided to put some things I’ve written in the past and connect with my current thinking, so let’s get on with it.
 
 Well, it’s been a really hard time on the course lately, so I think because it’s something that I love so much, it hurts so much, too. It’s torture, every day I come on campus and put on a mask, pretend like it’s okay and always laugh, it’s a very high wear and tear, especially because it’s innocent, so sometimes I’m doing something without realizing it, strange as it seems, I don’t feel like giving up or anything, but sometimes I think, if it’s worth it.
 
  I can’t complain about help, because if there’s one thing that I got on campus at all, it’s this, but it’s painful enough, you can see the pity of teachers, my grades and income have increased over time, But it was at the same time that the teachers understood my anxiety problem, which makes me question it every day. “I was approved by merit or piety?” And it bothers me every day, I feel like I’m being kicked, the way they treat me and talk to me, it just feels like pity, most of them are too nice to be normal.
 
In the matter of friendships is even worse, I’m afraid to say something and lose the friendship of the person, I get desperate if anything seems different from the ordinary, teachers I consider friends, I freak out if I think I said anything wrong, the fear of disappointing, the fear of failing, the fear of losing what little I have, are things I never deserved to have, so I can’t risk losing that. I consider myself quite selfish, so I prefer the happiness of others than mine, it seems to be something fairer with everyone.

 I have a lot of desire to do master’s and things like that, my biggest dream should be to get to teach at the top, especially if it could be here in the forest UFV same, I like a lot of the people I met, it would be a dream one day to teach next to them, but as I said it’s a dream, I don’t have enough grades to get into a master’s degree, I don’t have the capacity for the same and even worse condition to get into a university. So I don’t have many plans and no expectations for the future, since my dream is impossible, I’m going to form somehow, I’m going to lose contact with these teachers and classmates that I talked about, and I’ll probably go back to being like I always was before I got here, just another person who doesn’t have an opinion of his own, which is probably why I don’t care much about health and having several long years of life, Getting a degree will make me happy, because it’s something that shows my limit.
Like after I graduate I don’t have plans for the future anymore, I’m trying to have all the experiences.

## 22/08/2019

It was a little intense week.
It started out pretty hectic, I thought I was going to handle it, but it looks like I'm not iron lol.
I need to make some tough decisions, which had changed my whole routine from then on.
 It's funny, because I prefer when I have no choices, because I and I would never assume other possible results, but this time is different unfortunately.

The fear of disappointing someone I like so much makes me anxious. I am afraid to embrace an idea and not be able to meet these expectations.
I just feel tired, I don't know why.

I was fine with myself, before certain people gave me the light that I can achieve some things I never thought I could do.

It's a very stupid thing to shake me, but I don't know what I'm capable of and actually, I'm a little afraid to find out, some doors are starting to open, but by choosing one, all the others will probably close. forever.
There will come a time when I won't have people around to give me advice anymore and I will have to make my own decisions, taking full responsibility.

I feel like a perpetual sheikh, but at the same time I know I have everything to get out of it.

Let's see the trajectory that I would take, I thought it would go better in the materials would make me look different, but I stayed the same, the same way I entered here, I will leave without any change or way of thinking.
But I still have a little time, I'll bet everything I have over the last six years.

## 23/08/2019

 Shit, I can't believe I'm having these thoughts right now, maybe it's one o'clock in the morning.

I'm just tired of this feeling, I don't know exactly what that feeling is, it just bothers me, I can't stop thinking about what is to come.

I want to start over from scratch, I want to start over all my life, I want to believe that when I die, I have a chance to start over.

I don't know where I am

I don't know what I am

I don't know what I'm capable of
  
I don't know if I will achieve anything

I only know that I have goals that I will fulfill until the end, I intend to finish them all this year, so as not to regret it anymore.

I just wanted to be a telecenter of this life, I don't want to be a main character, much less an extra, just a telecenter to see where the people I admire so much will come.

I won't be able to show how much I am grateful to some people, so maybe walking away slowly is a good thing.

Jeez, as time flies, it's already three o'clock in the morning, I better stop now that anxiety has started to improve anyway, I need to study until the deadline arrives.

To sink or swim in order to survive
“dog eat dog world” I tell myself
What went wrong?
Survival of the fittest, the strongest will survive
If it’s the world that our wisdom will lead
Well, tell me what went wrong


I’ve paid my dues
I’ve sold my soul
So tell me, what is left for me
when I’ve given up everything


Can someone tell me how I use to picture
the scenes that I used to dream of?
I can’t seem to feel a thing
from this scenery
The more I look back the more I feel
like the person I am is empty inside


Can someone tell me how I use to picture
the scenes that I used to dream of?
I can’t seem to feel a thing
from this scenery
The more I look back the more I feel
like the person I am is empty inside


This world lost its clarity
the balance of good and evil
To kill or to be killed,
Is this the meaning of life
we’ve all fought so hard for?
