### About me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am twenty years old and I am a student in the Mathematics Degree course.
I am a little shy and quite exaggerated at times.
I am currently in the sixth period and seek to improve myself in mathematical games, focusing on education.
I'm certainly not the best at what I do, but I try to do my best, if I can teach at least one person using what I love, I'm already satisfied
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I want to start losing my shyness and do everything I once wanted, use all the time I have left
</p>
### Goals and dreams
<p style="text-align: justify;">

I don't have many dreams or goals, my only goal is to really get to form even with my problems.
I don't have much potential for bigger goals. At least that's what I thought two years ago. Now I have goals and a time limit to do them all, so I want to focus on smaller dreams, where I have a greater chance of success, and participate in as many projects as possible, I think this possibility to study some content with a person superior to you is incredible.
Nowadays, I really want to be able to reward all the help I received from my teachers and try to give them less work.

I work with R programming, with Game Maker, Unity.
