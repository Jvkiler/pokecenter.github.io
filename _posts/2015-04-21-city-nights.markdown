### Source
Experts believe that chess originated in Asía, the game was not very similar to what we know today. The earliest records refer to an ancient Hindu game called Chaturanga, very popular in the 6th century and played between four competitors.
The game was spreading rapidly through Russia and China. In the fifteenth century upon arriving in Europe began to change, with the inclusion of Bishop and Lady in the game.
From then on studies and clubs related to the game began to emerge studies and clubs linked to the practice, until the first tournaments began.
Chess is a very good game to play, because in addition to training your logical thinking, it will make you more focused, helps to make the brain fit, among other advantages.

### Is chess a sport?.
Although chess can also be included in a mental activity (like Curling and some other sports that also require a lot of concentration and strategy), chess has all the characteristics of a sport:

1) There are organized competitions and it is widespread worldwide.

2) It totally depends on the skill of the participants.

3) In competitions players usually lose weight.

4) Younger and better-off people benefit because in some games you need to sit or concentrate for up to 5 hours of matches. Younger people usually have better eyesight, which helps in the game (or lack of it can get in the way).

5) In VERY fast games like 5 minute matches, players often sweat and a few seconds can make a difference in the outcome of the game.

In conclusion, chess is an individual sport that closely resembles sports such as fencing, where fencing is replaced by pieces.
